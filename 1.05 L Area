/* You are given four variables width, height, x, y that describe the dimensions of a L-shape as shown in the image below. Determine the perimeter and area of the described L-shape. 
Store the value of the perimeter in a variable named perimeter, and the area in a variable named area.*/

var width = 8
var height = 12
var x = 2
var y = 3

var perimeter = 2 * ( height + width)

var area = (height * width) - (width - x) * (height - y)

print(perimeter, area)
