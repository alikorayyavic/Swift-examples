/* 1.9 Brothers
Everyone hates solving word problems by hand so letâ€™s make a program to solve them for us.
x years from now Alice will be y times older than her brother Bob. Bob is 12 years old. How many years does Alice have?*/

var x = 3
var y = 2
var bob = 12 

var alice   = y * (bob + x) - x 
print(alice)
